            <p>Without a clean soldering iron, you will always struggle to make a good joint.</p>
            <p>The tip of your iron, when hot, should be bright silver. If it is dull and brown, follow these steps to <em>clean</em> and <em>tin</em> it.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Heat up your iron.</li>
              <li>Clean any deposits off the tip using brass wool or a wet sponge.</li>
              <li>Melt some solder onto the tip, then it clean off using your brass wool or sponge.</li>
              <li>The flux in the centre of your solder will <em>clean</em> the tip, and the solder itself will <em>tin</em> it.</li>
              <li>Repeat this process a couple of times if necessary, to get a bright tip.</li>
              <li>If this is not working, you can use <em>tip tinner or cleaner</em>.
                This is a mixture of flux and solder, especially designed for this purpose.</li>
              <li>Push your hot iron into the paste, then wipe clean with your brass wool or sponge.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When you are finished, your iron's tip should be bright silver.</p>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Isioviel/isioviel.github.io/master/images/soldering/cleaning-iron.jpg" alt="clean soldering tip">
            <p><strong>When you have finished soldering, repeat steps 2 and 3 before turning off your iron.</strong></p>
            <p>This will keep the iron clean, making it easier to use in the future.</p>
            <p>If your soldering iron is old, or you have used it a lot, it might not clean effectively anymore. In this case, it might be time to buy a <em>new tip</em> for your iron.<p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-orange">Soldering your snowflake - step-by-step guide</h2>
            <p>Collect your components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A: 1x snowflake circuit board</li>
                <li>B: 4x LEDs, your choice of colour</li>
                <li>C: 1x battery holder</li>
                <li>D: 4x resistors, your choice of values (see next step)</li>
                <li>E: 1x slide switch</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\components.JPG" alt="photograph of the components, labelled occording to the list below">
            <br>
            <p>You will also need a <strong>CR2032 coin cell battery</strong>. If you are in Science Oxford's workshop, this will be given to you when you are ready to test your circuit board.</p>
            <p>Collect your tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soldering iron</li>
                <li>Wet sponge</li>
                <li>Solder</li>
                <li>Heat-proof surface</li>
                <li>Blue tack</li>
                <li>Wire snippers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 1: resistors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Test out resistor values <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7NjMSA8Fr2s" target="_blank">on Tinkercad</a>, and choose the most appropriate ones for your LEDs.</li>
              <li>Push your resistors into the holes labelled R1, R2, R3, R4 on your circuit board.</li>
            </ul>
              <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                      <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\resistors-front.JPG" alt="front of circuit board showing three resistors in place, and one half-way in">
                  </div>
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                      <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\resistors-back.JPG" alt="back of circuit board showing legs bent out">
                  </div>
              </div>
            <ul>
              <li>Once they are pushed through, bend the legs outwards slightly so that they don't fall out.</li>
              <li>Solder all eight connections.</li>
              <li>Trim down the legs using the wire snippers by <strong>holding the wire with one hand</strong>, and snipping with the other - this is to stop the bits of wire from pinging away!</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\snipping.JPG" alt="hand holding a resistor wire from the circuit board, other hand holding wire snippers at the base of the wire">

            <h3>Step 2: battery holder</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>On the back of the snowflake is a circle, with the label 'melt solder here' on it. Melting a <strong>thin</strong> layer of solder onto this circle will help to create a good connection for your battery. <strong>If you are in Science Oxford's workshop, this has already been done for you.</strong></li>
              <li>Line your battery holder up with the holes on the PCB, and push it all the way in until it is secure and flush with the board.</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\battery-holder.JPG" alt="battery holder in circuit board, pushed all the way in so it is flush with the board">
            <ul>
              <li>Turn the board over and solder the two battery holder connections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: switch</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>You can attach the switch either on the front or back of the board - your choice. Push it in your chosen direction, and use some blue tack to hold it in place.</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\switch.JPG" alt="battery holder in circuit board, pushed all the way in so it is flush with the board">
            <ul>
              <li>Solder all three legs of the switch then, once it has cooled down, remove the blue tack.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't trim down the legs of the switch</strong>, as they are too short to hold in place and cut safely. Once you have finished the whole circuit board, you can cover up the sharp edges.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: LEDs</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Unlike the other components we have used so far, <strong>LEDs will only work if they are soldered into the board the correct way round</strong>.</li>
              <li>For <strong>every LED</strong>:</li>
              <ol>
                  <li>Match it with its resistor (if you have different values) to decide which of the four spaces it should go in.</li>
                  <li>Identify the <strong>negative leg of your LED - this is the short leg</strong>, and line this up with the <strong>square hole</strong> on the circuit board.</li>
                  <li>Push your LED all the way in, then double-check that the short leg is in the square hole, and the long leg in the round hole.</li>
                  <li>Bend the legs outwards slightly to stop it from falling out.</li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
            <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\LEDs.JPG" alt="four LEDs in the circuit board, view from above, board balancing on the LED legs">
            <ul>
              <li>Solder all eight connections.</li>
              <li><strong>Don't trim down the legs yet</strong> - you are going to test it first!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: testing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Check all of your solder joints to make sure they look good. <strong>If you are in Science Oxford's workshop, ask a workshop leader to check it.</strong> </li>
              <li>Push a CR2032 coin cell battery into the battery holder - you need to push quite hard to get it all the way in.</li>
              <li>Test your board - do all of the LEDs come on? Do they turn on and off when you slide the switch?</li>
              <li>If your circuit doesn't work as expected, make sure that none of the LED legs are touching each other, and check your solder joints again.</li>
              <li>If your circuit works, then you can trim the legs of the LEDs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: finishing touches</h3>
            <p>Now that your snowflake lights up, you can add some more personal touches! Some suggestions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose a ribbon or string to hang it with.</li>
              <li>Cover any sharp wires with a hot glue gun or some foam tape.</li>
              <li>Decorate the white surface with marker pens.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can also get lovely higher quality kits to make
              badges to wear, or something functional such as a battery tester.</p>
            <p><a href="https://boldport.com/" target="_blank">Boldport</a> kits are both beautiful and (sometimes) functional,
              and come with great documentation!</p>
